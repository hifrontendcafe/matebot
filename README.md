## Getting Started

These instructions will help you install and run the project on your local machine for development.

### Installation

To install the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Create an `.env` file and add the environment variables needed, you can find the environment variables you'll need in the [`.env.example`](.env.example) file.
2. Install project dependencies by running the command:

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

### Development

To run the project locally, execute:

> [!NOTE]
> The first time running may require re-execute the command.

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

The development server should reload on every file change.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> After creating new commands or making changes on any of the commands structure you'll need to [redeploy them](#deployingregistering-commands).

<details>
  <summary><h4>Creating New Commands</h4></summary></br>

To create a new command, create a new file in the **[commands](src/commands)** directory. The file name should match the name of the command. For example, to create a command called _hello_, create a file called _`hello.js`_.

The command file should export both `data` and `execute` [as seem here](src/commands/testing/_ping.ts).

> [!WARNING]
> Make sure you put every command file inside the **[`src/commands`](src/commands)** folder or in it's subfolders.

<details>
  <summary><h4>Handle Discord Events</h4></summary>

To handle an event, create a new file in the **[events](src/events)** directory. The file name should match the name of the event. For example, to handle the _messageCreate_ event, create a file called _`message-create.js`_.

The event file should export both `data` and `execute` from each event file, [as seem here](src/events/ready.ts).

> [!WARNING]
> Make sure you put every event file inside the **[`src/events`](src/events)** folder or in it's subfolders.

</details>

### Deployment

Deployment is done automatically with GitHub Actions; If you need to redeploy it manually, follow these steps:

1. Install the Fly.io CLI [from their website](https://fly.io/docs/hands-on/install-flyctl/)
2. Authenticate with FrontendCafe's Fly.io account.

   ```bash
   flyctl auth login
   ```

3. Execute the deploy command

   ```bash
   flyctl deploy --ha=false
   ```

#### Deploying/Registering Commands

After creating new commands or making changes on any of the commands structure _(not the `execute` function logic)_, you will need to run:

```bash
pnpm run register
```

> [!WARNING]
> If the `NODE_ENV` variable is set to `"production"`, it will deploy the commands **globally** to all servers were the bot is already invited.

#### Update the environment variables

To modify environment variables on Fly.io, run the following command:

```bash
flyctl secrets import < .env
```

> [!important]
> This will read your local `.env` file and update all of the environment variables.
